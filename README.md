We define the interesting triples as follows:
In an integer array nums, there exist three distinct subscripts i, j, k, and the relationship between the three subscripts is

0 â‰¤ i < j < k < nums.length

for the above three increasing subscripts 

with nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]

satisfying the above conditions, then we can say that there are interesting triples in this integer array.
